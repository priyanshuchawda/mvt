# Mean Value Theorem Calculator

A sophisticated Python calculator for computing and visualizing the points guaranteed by the Lagrange Mean Value Theorem (LMVT) and Rolle's Theorem.

## Features

- Symbolic and numerical computation of Mean Value Theorem points
- Automatic fallback from symbolic to numerical methods for complex functions
- Beautiful visualizations of functions, secant lines, tangent lines, and MVT points
- Support for a wide range of mathematical functions including polynomials, trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions
- High-precision arithmetic with mpmath for accurate results with transcendental functions
- Multiple numerical solvers for robust solutions
